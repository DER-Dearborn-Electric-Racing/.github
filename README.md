Formula SAE Electric : University of Michigan - Dearborn

This GitHub organization hosts the software and electronics development for Dearborn Electric Racing. Our work focuses on the systems that control the car, collect data, and support the team’s engineering workflow.


## Tools used in development and competition 

- MoTeC M150 ECU for powertrain control and data acquisition
- Teensy 4.0/4.1 microcontrollers for testing and custom embedded systems
- Vehicle sensors including wheel speed, suspension travel, temperature, pressure, IMU, etc for control and logging
- CAN2.0 communication accross all major subsystems


## Future Development

We plan to expand the orginization with:
- A team-built website to replace our current Weebly site
- Data processing and visualization tools for telemetry, testing, and performance analysis
- Simulation and modeling utilities that integrate with vehicle data
- Improved internal tools for documentation, workflows, and version control

This space will continue to grow as the team develops new systems and infrastructure
